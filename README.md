# SimpleMirror
A simple version of the popular MagicMirror application

## Why...
I spent far too long trying to use frameworks like Angular and React to create my own version of the MagicMirror application.
So after attempt after attempt, I decided to simply use plain Javascript to create my mirror application which i'm dubbing "SimpleMirror"/
.

## Hardware
I plan to run SimpleMirror from a raspberryPi zero-w. The RPi should run chromium in fullscreen mode so that only the SimpleMirror
display is visible.
